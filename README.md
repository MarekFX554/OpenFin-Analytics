**Democratizing Institutional-Grade Trading Education.**

OpenFin Analytics is an open-source, non-commercial initiative designed to provide aspiring traders and students with a risk-free environment to backtest and master **Smart Money Concepts (SMC)**.

## 🚀 Mission

Financial education typically hides behind expensive paywalls and "guru" courses. We are building a platform that provides:
1.  **Professional Tools:** Access to institutional-grade charting without monthly fees.
2.  **SMC Logic Engine:** Automated detection of Order Blocks, FVGs, and Liquidity Sweeps for educational analysis.
3.  **Risk-Free Environment:** A sophisticated paper-trading sandbox.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

We are leveraging modern web technologies to build a responsive and powerful application:

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS.
*   **Charting:** Integration with **TradingView Advanced Charts** (Pending Approval).
*   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) for data processing.
*   **Data:** Open-source historical market data.

## 📅 Roadmap

We are currently in the **Pre-Alpha** phase, focusing on the core logic engine.

*   **Q1 2025:** Core Backtesting Engine architecture.
*   **Q3 2025:** Integration of TradingView Charting Libraries.
*   **Q1 2026:** Alpha Testing (Closed Group).
*   **Q4 2026:** Public Beta Launch.

## 🤝 Contribution

This is a community-driven project. While we are currently setting up the core infrastructure, we will open the repository for public contributions in the coming months.
